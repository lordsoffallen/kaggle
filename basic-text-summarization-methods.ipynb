Mia De Graaf . Britons flocked to beaches across the southern coast yesterday as millions look set to bask in glorious sunshine today. Temperatures soared to 17C in Brighton and Dorset, with people starting their long weekend in deck chairs by the sea. Figures from Asda suggest the unexpected sunshine has also inspired a wave of impromptu barbecues, with sales of sausages and equipment expected to triple those in April. Sun's out: Brighton beach was packed with Britons enjoying the unexpected sunshine to start the long weekend as temperatures hit 17C across the south coast . Although frost is set to hit the south tonight - with temperatures dropping to 1C - Britons stocking up for a barbecue will be in luck tomorrow, with forecasters predicting dry and sunny weather across southern England, southern Wales and the south Midlands. In Weymouth, Dorset, the sun came out in time for the town's annual kite festival, held on the beach. But the good weather has not been enjoyed by all as heavy rain poured down across the north west. Unfortunately, the dark clouds and intermittent rain across northern England and Scotland is set to last throughout the long weekend and into Tuesday. However, the north east enjoyed a bright spell at midday today with sun shining in Harrogate and York ahead of the rainy weekend. Met Office spokesman Helen Roberts told MailOnline: 'It hasn't been great for the whole country - it's been a story of two halves. Crowds took to deckchairs to see in the Bank Holiday weekend on Brighton beach - while rain and clouds swept the country up north . Frost and temperatures of 1C are forecast to hit southern England tonight, but those planning a barbecue can bank on a dry, sunny day tomorrow . According to the Met Office, today's temperatures in Brighton were not unusual for this time of year, but it follows a windy and wet spell . 'The best of the sunshine has been . towards to south and south east, and further north there's been a lot of . cloud and outbreaks of rain. Tomorrow will be a similar picture. 'These temperatures are about . average for this time of the year. We might see 17C tomorrow but not . much higher. 'The most unusual thing is overnight minimum temperatures, which are really going to be quite low. We're looking at a touch of air frost tonight in places in the south, where there will be clear skies. That's not common for May.' Tonight, cloud and drizzle . is expected to cast over northern and western areas of the country, with . heavier bursts of rain in Scotland. Summer time: Many took to the sun wearing bikinis and sarongs for the first weekend as Britons gear themselves up for summer . Activity: The sun came out in time for the opening day of Weymouth Kite Festival, which sees people from all over come to show off creative kites . Three day forecast: Tomorrow sunny spells and warm weather is set to cover southern England, but the heavy rain up north is set to stay . Southern and eastern England looks set to remain dry,clear, and mild, despite cold temperatures in East Anglia. The intermittent rain and cloud currently sweeping across the north is set to last throughout Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. Cloud . and rain will spread into northern and western parts of the country on . Bank Holiday Monday, with heavy rain in the evening. Apart from a few showers, southern and central parts of England should be largely dry with some warm sunshine breaking through. Though rain poured down in the north west, the north east enjoyed a bright spell at midday today with sun shining in Harrogate ahead of the rainy weekend .

Each summary differs from the other in subtle ways, and we have to rely on our subjective evaluation. This is certainly a challenge in selecting a method that works best for a given use case. Let's have a look at commonly used\naccuracy metrics and see how they can be used to empirically select the best method for summarization. We must understand that to automatically evaluate the summary of some given text, there must be a reference summary that it can be compared with. Typically, this is a summary written by a human and is referred to as the gold standard. Every automatically generated summary can be compared with the gold standard to get an accuracy measure. This also gives us the opportunity to easily compare multiple methods and choose the best one. However, we will often run into the issue that a human-\ngenerated summary may not exist for every use case. In such situations, we can choose a proxy measure to be considered as the gold standard. An example in the case of a news article would be the headline. While it is written by a human, it is a poor proxy as it can be quite short and is not an accurate summary but more of a leading statement to draw users. While this may not give us the best results, it is still useful to compare the performance of different summarization methods.\n\nRecall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) is one of the most commonly used methods to measure the accuracy of a summary. There are several types of ROUGE metrics, but the basic idea is simple. It arrives at the measure of accuracy by comparing the number of shared terms between the automatically generated summary and the gold standard. ROUGE-N is a metric that measures the number of common n-grams (ROUGE-1 compares individual words, ROUGE-2 compares bigrams, and so on)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"! pip install rouge-score","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-05T15:49:30.820394Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-05T15:49:30.820870Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-05T15:49:45.501156Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-05T15:49:30.820815Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-05T15:49:45.499960Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":20,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Collecting rouge-score\n  Downloading rouge_score-0.1.2.tar.gz (17 kB)\n  Preparing metadata (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25ldone\n\u001b[?25hRequirement already satisfied: absl-py in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from rouge-score) (1.4.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: nltk in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from rouge-score) (3.2.4)\nRequirement already satisfied: numpy in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from rouge-score) (1.24.3)\nRequirement already satisfied: six>=1.14.0 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from rouge-score) (1.16.0)\nBuilding wheels for collected packages: rouge-score\n  Building wheel for rouge-score (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25ldone\n\u001b[?25h  Created wheel for rouge-score: filename=rouge_score-0.1.2-py3-none-any.whl size=24932 sha256=8778c864e43811dc4698f03d8ff81aa1ba3de353d540c454efdd926ea9cfe2e8\n  Stored in directory: /root/.cache/pip/wheels/5f/dd/89/461065a73be61a532ff8599a28e9beef17985c9e9c31e541b4\nSuccessfully built rouge-score\nInstalling collected packages: rouge-score\nSuccessfully installed rouge-score-0.1.2\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import rouge_score as rouge\nfrom rouge_score.rouge_scorer import RougeScorer\n\n\ndef print_rouge_score(rouge_scores):\n    for k,v in rouge_scores.items():\n        print (k, 'Precision:', \"{:.2f}\".format(v.precision), 'Recall:', \"{:.2f}\".format(v.recall), 'fmeasure:', \"{:.2f}\".format(v.fmeasure))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-05T15:49:57.826314Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-05T15:49:57.826796Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-05T15:49:57.905513Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-05T15:49:57.826757Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-05T15:49:57.903718Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":21,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"gold_standard = highlights0\nsummary = ''.join(textrank_summary(article0, 3))\n\nscorer = RougeScorer(['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL'], use_stemmer=True)\nscores = scorer.score(gold_standard, summary)\nprint('\\nTextRank Results: \\n')\nprint_rouge_score(scores)\n\nsummary = ''.join(lsa_summary(article0, 3))\nscores = scorer.score(gold_standard, summary)\nprint('\\nLSA Results: \\n')\nprint_rouge_score(scores)\n\nsummary = ''.join(tfidf_summary(article0, 3))\nscores = scorer.score(gold_standard, summary)\nprint('\\nTF-IDF Results: \\n')\nprint_rouge_score(scores)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-05T15:49:59.617275Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-05T15:49:59.618359Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-05T15:49:59.734458Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-05T15:49:59.618317Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-05T15:49:59.733225Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":22,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\nTextRank Results: \n\nrouge1 Precision: 0.23 Recall: 0.42 fmeasure: 0.30\nrouge2 Precision: 0.06 Recall: 0.12 fmeasure: 0.08\nrougeL Precision: 0.10 Recall: 0.17 fmeasure: 0.12\n\nLSA Results: \n\nrouge1 Precision: 0.30 Recall: 0.43 fmeasure: 0.36\nrouge2 Precision: 0.04 Recall: 0.06 fmeasure: 0.05\nrougeL Precision: 0.13 Recall: 0.19 fmeasure: 0.16\n\nTF-IDF Results: \n\nrouge1 Precision: 0.22 Recall: 0.40 fmeasure: 0.28\nrouge2 Precision: 0.02 Recall: 0.04 fmeasure: 0.03\nrougeL Precision: 0.09 Recall: 0.17 fmeasure: 0.12\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The original ROUGE paper compared how many of the words that appear in the gold standard also appear in the automatically generated summary. So if most of the words present in the gold standard were also present in the generated summary, we would achieve a high score. However, this metric alone does not tell the whole story. Consider that we generate a verbose summary that is long but includes most of the words in the gold standard. This summary\nwould have a high score, but it would not be a good summary since it doesn’t provide a concise representation. This is why the ROUGE measure has been extended to compare the number of shared words to the total number of words in the generated summary as well. This indicates the precision: the number of words in the generated summary that are actually useful. We can combine these measures to generate the F-score.","metadata":{}}]}
